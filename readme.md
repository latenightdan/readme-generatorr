# Readme Generator

 ## Description 
   This app automatically produces readmes with this format through the terminal

 ## Installation 
    To install the app, add both the node.js, and inquirer packages. You install these by typing npm install node.js, and npm install inquirer into the folder you run it from.

## Usage 
    After installing the packages, type node index into the terminal. This will begin a series of prompts which will lead you to producing a quality readme.

## Contributions 
    I did the whole thing. However, I couldn't have done it without the Rutgers Coding bootcamp!
    
## Test App 
     You answer the prompts, and see if it generates a readme!
